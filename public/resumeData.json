    "description":"I love tackling questions arising from genetics and neuroscience with algebraic geometry and combinatorial tools. I recently joined Kaie Kubjas' group at Aalto University in Helsinki where I am working on several projects which involve real algebraic varieties, polynomial optimisation, phylogenetic invariants, tensor decomposition, and colored best match graphs.",

    "bio":"Thank you for checking out my website. I studied bioinformatics and worked as neuroimaging data analyst in the US for almost 5 years, before that I was in Italy where I graduated with a Master and PhD in Mathematics. I relocated in Finland to my new adventure in December 2019. Outside work I love spending time with friends and family, meditating, cycling, doing pilates, and all kind of outdoor activities.",
    "contactmessage":"I am looking for a second postdoc to start anytime between January-June 2020. Email me if you have an opening in your group or a project where my expertises can help!",
